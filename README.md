Translations
============

These files are used for the main DasCrypto application. If you are interested
in translating it into a specific locale, please make a PR.

File Format: {domain}.{locale}.xlf

# Domains

* `messages` - Generic
* `security` - Security related messages
* `validators` - Validation related messages

I may add more domains as the app grows larger. Until that happens, most
translations will be in the `messages` file.
